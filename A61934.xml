            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> late Embassador in <hi>Turky,</hi> being eminently publique; and many scandals being cast upon the Merchants, and upon the present Embassador, by private whispers of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> and his Agents: It is become even necessary to expose the following papers to publique view; being the copies of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sac. Crowes Warrants, Instructions</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> to his Agents, and of some of their <hi>Returnes:</hi> together with the <hi>Factors letters</hi> unto the Company here; giving an account of his attempts against them.</p>
            <p>And whosoever shall esteeme it worth his time to be truly informed of the matters in difference, as they depended before the late, and this present Parliament; may collect from these Papers, the true state of the controversie: The most materiall of which are confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> before a Committee of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have passed under his own hand and Seale; and the others also will be as easily proved.</p>
            <p>But be pleased first to understand the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Levant</hi> (or <hi>Turky</hi>) Company and S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow.</hi> He was first employed in the yeare 1638. as Embassador or Agent to Constantinople: and although he was dignified (as was usual) with the title of the Kings Embassador or Resident, and his Commission; yet it was not an Embassy upon matters of State, there being only Capitulations and peace for freedom of Trade between the Turkes and the English; and S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> under that honorable name, was the Levant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Agent or publique Minister, upon severall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and covenants mutually passed between them:
<pb facs="tcp:38106:3"/> and as Their Agent only, the Company paid for the transportation and provision of himselfe, his <hi>Lady,</hi> and all his retinue: and also gave him Sixe hundred pounds as advance, for the furniture and ornament of his house at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and covenanted to allow him a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salary of neere Two thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which was paid him quarterly beforehand. And He covenanted <hi>to take care of the publique good of the Companies trade,</hi> and impartially <hi>to see it ordered by the rules and orders made by them:</hi> and <hi>to assist their Treasurer to cause the costs and charges of any Avania,</hi> (or Turkish charge upon fictitious pretences) <hi>that should happen upon a Nationall cause, to be borne by all the Company of Trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs there, in indifferent proportions, as their Treasurer and the English nation there should thinke fit:</hi> and <hi>that he should not exact any Levy of moneys, or forcibly take the goods or moneys of any of the Traders there, upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever without the Companies order under Seale.</hi> This was the summe and substance of the trust reposed by the Company in S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> (with some other things less materiall) to which he was obliged by Articles under his hand and seale.</p>
            <p>Now the most gross, palpable and infamous breach of this publique trust, to the high dishonour of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish nation in the eyes of Turkes and Infidels, and to the utmost hazard of the loss and ruine of a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of the English Trade, and of the lives and fortunes of many of the English Nation, This is the subject matter of the Levant Companies complaint against S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow:</hi> and the following Papers speak enough to be sufficient proof on their behalfe: from these every judicious eye may collect cleere evidence, that S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> did not only cast aside <hi>that care of the publique good of the Companies trade, and observing their
<pb facs="tcp:38106:3"/> rules and orders,</hi> unto which he was obliged by Covenant; But also that he assumed and usurped to himselfe an absolute arbitrary power over all the Companies Estates in Turky, and their Factors Persons; and to be their absolute and supreme Judge even in his own case; and that he demeaned himselfe, as if he had been absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all his Covenants; pursuing by all undue meanes of force and fraud his private interest, to the ruine of the Trade. And to make these Papers speake in method and order, be pleased (good Reader) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from them,</p>

               <hi>He is advised of an English Ship arrived about Smyrna, which by advice from within rides without, and resolves for Scanderone, and to discharge and relade there; But he hoped to get a command for the Chiaus to secure that other Corner also.</hi> And the same letters also give cleere evidence that his further designe was, to transport himselfe and the English estates he could swallow, out of Turky into some other forraine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; As in another letter to his complices,<note n="k" place="margin">Page 33. 85.</note>

               <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> was inraged at the stealing any English goods aboard, or the departure of any ship: He esteeming it all to be lost out of his purse; having swallowed in his hopes the whole English estate in that Empire.

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, these following Papers will shew the <hi>Disguises</hi> which S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> invented and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the more plausible carrying on this his grand and black Designe. First, he imposed a <hi>Leviation</hi> or taxe upon the English Estates, of <hi>a Hundred and ten thousand Dollars;</hi> under colour of a necessity for so much to satisfy the Companies debts: Requiring the same to be paid in <hi>ready money,</hi> when he told his Agents<note n="o" place="margin">15. 16.</note> he knew it to be impossible; whom yet he instructed <hi>to take no security,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">16.</note>
               <hi>no not all the Nation for one mans taxe:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he allow any time, when the Factors would submit to his Leviation, if they might have time to raise the money: But in pursuance of his secret Designe, he gives out Warrants and Instructions to <hi>Enter Warehouses and Comptinghouses, and seize upon all Goods, Money and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes;</hi> that thereby he might not only have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:38106:5"/> to begin to rifle the English Estates, but to <hi>Discover</hi> them; and this with less odium and scandall from the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> and with more assistance from the <hi>Turkish</hi> officers, then would have bin, if his secret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe had been fallen upon bare-faced. Yet to make it beyond dispute, that This was only intended in order to the designe of swallowing up all; The Reader may please to observe that this Leviation was and is by S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> himselfe acknowledged to be a<note n="q" place="margin">15. 16. 16. 18. 19. 47. 48.</note> Colour: His Agents being ordered<note n="r" place="margin">38.</note> to make that the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of all their other worke; and<note n="s" place="margin">49.</note> not to discover his owne pretences till the last. As also that some of the Factors, hoping to prevent his further oppression, made tender of their part of the Leviation in money to S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> himselfe; and he refused it, and gave order to his Agents at Smyrna,<note n="t" place="margin">29.</note>
               <hi>to arrest the person and goods of</hi> Mr. Daniell Edwards, <hi>that offered it, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his tender of his money;</hi> and said <hi>he longed to have him in his power.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Brandon,</hi> another of the Factors, offering likewise his part, S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, unless he would discover where all his Estate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Brandon</hi> denying, S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> sends for his Broker, commanding a discovery from him, as also from M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>James Mudiford:</hi> But they still refusing, S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> vowed that if it were between Heaven and Earth he would find it out: &amp; thereupon, on S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackviles</hi> command, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Brandon</hi> was clapt in Chaines. Nay<note n="u" place="margin">30. 34.</note>
               <hi>the full of the Leviation would not be accepted:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">40. 48.</note> Nor being paid, might the Factors be afterwards at liberty to lade their goods; But<note n="*" place="margin">29. 30.</note> still his instruments are directed to seize. And this first disguise of a Leviation, carried Two more in his bowels; The one was, a seizure of more goods for charges, when they had enough double and treble for the Leviation; and those he set at 36000
<pb facs="tcp:38106:5"/> Dollars: The other was to appraise the goods his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents should Seize, at halfe values; That when his new pretences for his secret Designe should come, he might not want colour for swallowing up the whole.</p>
            <p>The next maske of his designe was a meere fained pretence<note n="x" place="margin">Page 7</note> that the Parliament had sequestred his Estate in England, by the companies procurement; and therefore He would repaire himselfe out of theirs in Turky: and then he values his Estate at 297000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (neere 80000 pound sterling) whereas it is belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had not a visible Estate to 3000 pound Value.</p>
            <p>An other pretence was,<note n="y" place="margin">6. 7 29.</note> a claime of 174000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for Consulage due to him; although he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted under hand and Seale with the Company <hi>to assist in collecting that money for Them, to be paid to Their Treasurer;</hi> That being the usuall Receipt out of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany defray the extraordinary Charge of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and other Ministers abroad. But as he instructed his servants about the seizing some of the Factors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note n="z" place="margin">50. 51.</note>
               <hi>to Make a pretence, if they could not find one, for</hi> (he said) <hi>it was all one to him,</hi> so the worke were done; So he practiseth himselfe to forge and invent pretences to devoure the Companies Estates; that his rapine and violence might not be seene unmasked, least they should have lost the opportunity to act it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, Let the Reader observe from these papers what unhappy Meanes, suitable to his Ends, he found out for compassing his designe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By false insinuations to the Vizier, he procures countenance from him for an Embargo: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<note n="a" place="margin">1. 4. 11. 23. 26. 39. 41. 45.</note>
               <hi>he arrests all the ships of the English at Smirna and Constantinople; and prohibites also the Lading of any goods; and commands the persons of any that should presume to lade,
<pb facs="tcp:38106:6"/> to be arrested; and those that could not be apprehended, to be proclaimed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">26. 35. 69.</note>
               <hi>Rebells: and</hi> so he afterwardes styled most of the English Nation there. And he further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands<note n="b" place="margin">44. 45. 46.</note>
               <hi>Accounts to be given to his Agents by the Masters of the ships, of all the goods on board; and they to enter into all Ships, Warehouses or Counting houses; and to take into their power all Bookes of Accompts, Bills of Debt, Acquittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Letters, or other writings or evidence whatsoever belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to any English whatsoever; and the same to keepe and and make use of in evidence.</hi> Thus under<note n="c" place="margin">Page 31. 33. 35.</note> a feyned Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of command from that State, he practised to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure the whole English Estate, that none might escape his fingers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ordered Rewards and promises to be made and given to Informers (without reserving his Agents within any bounds) that they might discover the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, goods and debts of the Company. And<note n="d" place="margin">Page 16.</note> He orders his servants <hi>to employ some Jew or Armenian Brokers (under pretence of Bargains) to discover the English Estates:</hi> And his Agents<note n="e" place="margin">Page 58.</note> make him returne to these Instructions, <hi>That they had employed the most cunning Rogues in all the Countrey, to see if they could discover any other part of the Nations Estate either hid or lying out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He ordered<note n="f" place="margin">Page 10. 18. 20. 32. 35. 36. 41. 50.</note> the Bribing of the <hi>Cady,</hi> the <hi>Neipe,</hi> the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> the <hi>Customer,</hi> and all the Turkish officers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ministers, to gaine their assistance in his designe: and herein he gives his Agents<note n="g" place="margin">Page 21.</note>
               <hi>Latitude without limit;</hi> and tells them againe and againe<note n="h" place="margin">Page 10. 18. 19. 20. 41.</note>
               <hi>That they must spare no Cost;</hi> assuring them <hi>they may charge</hi> 10000 <hi>Dollars upon him by bills for that use,</hi> and commands them<note n="i" place="margin">Page 52. 54.</note> to <hi>pawne</hi> the goods they seaze, for the same end; That they might buy the Turkish Ministers to execute his cruelty upon the Factors, and helpe to possess him of the companies Estate. And to make his Agents most impudent and
<pb facs="tcp:38106:6"/> fearless in what they did, he gives them assurance in a boasting manner<note n="k" place="margin">Page 38.</note> That the <hi>Merchants should never have right against them, so long as they themselves had any thing to bribe the contrary:</hi> and he bad them<note n="l" place="margin">Page 53.</note>
               <hi>Value themselves and their service at what rate they pleased, and they should be recompensed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He ordered his Servants to ingratiate themselves with all the Turkes; who were apt to mutiny by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horrid rapine and injustice executed upon the traders with whom they dealt: and therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to <hi>spare no charge</hi> in presents,<note n="m" place="margin">Page 18. 40. 63.</note> to make the very Townsmen of their party; and to perswade them <hi>that all that was done, was intended for the better regulation and advance of Trade;</hi> which he said was only in his power to increase and regulate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And yet to Secure himselfe of the whole English Estate more certainly, he tooke care to prevent the interposition of the justice of the very Infidells, which he feared might protect the Merchants from his oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: Therefore he informed the Vizier,<note n="n" place="margin">Page 26.</note> that divers English ships were joyned with the Venetian Fleet, the Turkes Enemy, and attended to give Battle to the Grand Signiors Fleete: and also<note n="o" place="margin">Page 82.</note> that some ships had been Laden by the Merchants with Powder and prohibited goods, for the Enemies supplies: And<note n="p" place="margin">Page 69.</note> counsells his Servants at Smirna to procure from the Turkish Ministers there, most dangerous and false Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, <hi>That the Factors perswaded the people of the place to mutinie:</hi> By this meanes exposing the Factors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at least to Slavery in the Gallies, if not death by Torments, and the Companies Estates to a certaine confiscation; if the Vizier himselfe had not discerned his falseness and Avanious designes against his own Nation. And though his allegations had not full credit;
<pb facs="tcp:38106:7"/> yet, by them he obstructed, at least for a time, the only meanes of releife which the factors could expect; hoping in the interim to make sure of most of their Estate.</p>
            <p>Thus He that was employed and trusted cheifely (as occasion should happen) to mediate with the Grand Signor and his Ministers that the Capitulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the English might be kept,<note place="margin">See Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <hi>to use the Turkish ayde</hi> against the Merchants persons and Estates, whatever came of it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, These papers will give you an account what <hi>progresse</hi> S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> made in the <hi>Execution</hi> of his intended rapine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Orders for arresting the Ships in port, tooke such unhappy effect, by his subtilty in gaining Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Commands upon false suggestions,<note place="margin">P. 78.</note> that some ships were stayed in port neare 7 moneths; to an insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table damage of the Merchants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He actually<note n="*" place="margin">.</note> forced the payment of 110000 Dollars, under colour of a Leviation: and also<note n="*" place="margin">Page 80</note> Bonds for 25000 Dollars, under colour of maintenance for himselfe and his family.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Servants prevailed so effectually with the Turkish officers, That * they seized and imprisoned, first the Consul and most principall of the Factors at
<pb facs="tcp:38106:7"/> Smirna; and afterwards most of the rest: and with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelty<note n="*" place="margin">Page 91.</note> haled the Consul and Sixe of the cheife of that factory to a darke and close Dungeon, with the doores and windowes nailed upon them, in the extreame heate of Summer: Where they had in probability perished, if the mercy of the Turkes had not been prevailed upon with a bribe of 100 Dollars, to exceed the mercy of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackviles</hi> Servants, and to open a window for light and ayre. And at the same time they forced away from the Consul there the Imperiall Capitulations, which were the only security of the English against Death or Slavery by the Turkes. And within a few daies they hurried their Prisoners with Turkish guards 350 miles overland to Constantinople, to imprison them in S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crowes</hi> owne House: Many of their fellow Factors being soone after brought in like manner to partake of the same bondage. And what he acted by his cruel Agents at Smirna, He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe undertooke to execute upon the Factory at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople; where taking the opportunity of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Court or meeting of the Nation; He caused the Gates to be shut, and by surprise tooke them all his Prisoners; and set strong guards upon them, to prevent all accesse to them, and their sending the least paper abroad; some of them also being clapt in Chaines.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He caused the Counting houses, Warehouses and Chambers of the English at Constantinople, to be sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and sealed up. And his servants Hetherington and Zuma did the same to the whole English Nation at Smirna; and proceeded also to breake open and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all their Chambers, Trunkes and Counting houses; and to plunder and carry away unto Turkish Canes, all money, goods, faculties and effects whatsoever they could find, either at home or abroad: Exposing their
<pb facs="tcp:38106:8"/> Servants and Families to the mercy of the Infidells for their subsistence.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">P. 83.</note>5. He breathed forth most severe threats and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces by his Agents, against the Servants and families of the Factors, to extort from them discovery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Masters Estates and debts, and for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Bookes; intending to devoure the whole: and the dread of the Turkish Souldiers and Officers (whose tiranny was so higly menaced) so affrighted the Factors Servants, that they fled to ships for refuge; leaving the plundered Houses to the open world.</p>
            <p>Thus the Reader will find S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crowes</hi> Cruelty and vigor in Executing, to be no less, then his subtilty and policy in Contriving his designe of rapine upon the Companies Estates: and if the outcries and clamors of the Jewes and Turkes against such horrid oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and destructive courses to all future Trade,<note place="margin">P. 82. 93.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some Presents made to the Vizier by some few of the factors that fortunately escaped imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had not caused the Turkish justice to interpose, and redeeme the Merchants Estates, and the Factors persons from his cruell and covetous hands, his designe had certainly been fully successefull.</p>
            <p>Now let the Reader judge whether the Company were not obliged for their owne preservation, upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of these horrid attempts of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> to seeke some present redress. And this they did by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble addresses to the late Parliament, who were pleased to order<note n="*" place="margin">P. 95.</note> his Revocation; and by ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament<note n="*" place="margin">P. 97.</note> to authorise S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Thomas Bendishe</hi> to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador in S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crowes</hi> stead. Yet when S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bendishe</hi> arrived) S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> contemnes the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whereby he was sent; and pretends him to be no other then an Impostor, who had counterfeited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
<pb facs="tcp:38106:8"/> for an Embassy; although his authority (being both from the King and the Parliament) was as great as ever any Embassador carried into Turky: and he secretly insinuated to the Vizier, that the English Nation there were most of them Rebells; and S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Thomas Bendyshe</hi> intended to be their Head: Suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also that he had Letters from the King to the Grand Signor for his owne continuance in the Embassy; hoping to have hindered the reception of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Thomas Bendyshe.</hi> But when the falsehood of his pretences ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Vizier, He caused his owne officers to send him on board a Turkish Vessell to Smirna, to be from thence shipped for England, to be dealt with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his demerits. And upon his arrivall here in <hi>April</hi> 1648,<note n="*" place="margin">Page 99.</note> the Parliament committed him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to the Tower of London in order to his Tryall; and referred the Companies Complaints to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Committie for the Navy: and severall witnesses in the case were by them examined; although the Report was not made, through the cunning arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of S<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> to delay the full hearing of the Cause. But it is humbly submitted to every ingenuous Reader, whether there was not cause sufficient to send home S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow:</hi> and whether S <hi>Thomas Bendishe</hi> was not obliged in faithfulnsse to his trust, to proceed as he did, in order to the performing his owne Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy: And whether the hand of Justice might not have fallen heavy upon S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> if there had been that vigorous prosecution which the blacknesse of his designes against the Company might have provoked them unto. Yet if S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>Sackvile</hi> had not by private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, and by pamplets (in a very secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous way dispersed) lately endeavoured to blast the Companies and the Embassadors reputation; and
<pb facs="tcp:38106:9"/> also to have insinuated most false complaints of great injuries done to him by the Company; and if he had not commenced vexatious Suites at Law against them, upon hopes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dvantage by the patience and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they have shewed towards him: These his crimes had not been made thus publique; being done without thought of Malice or prejudice to his person; and not without greife and shame That one who enjoyed so faire an Income from the Company, and underwent but an easy Expence, and therefore could not but be master of a very ample Estate; should thus <hi>betray</hi> them who <hi>intrusted</hi> and <hi>maintained</hi> him; and so wilfully purchase ruine to himselfe, with the expence of his owne fortunes, and <hi>above one hundred thousand Pounds</hi> loss to the Company.</p>

               <p>WHereas the <hi>Levant</hi> Company, somtime before our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this place, by a Court of their Assistants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto specially authorized, treated with us touching a yeerly allowance for our care and paines during our residence here as his Majesties Ambassador; to bee had and taken in such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38106:11"/> as might have relation to their trade and occasions: And for a conclusion of such treaty as aforesaid, did offer unto us the election of any one of their agreements, formerly made with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Predecessors in like occasion.

And whereas wee thereon, and to the purposes and ends afore mentioned, chose and fixed upon that agreement, which the said Company had made with Sir <hi>Thomas Glover,</hi> formerly Ambassador, Resident for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> with this state: and his Majestie by his favour did assure the same unto us, gratiously promising to make his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of us here, as good and beneficial in all the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

The said Company, finding themselvs mistaken in their offer (as they pretended) first retired from the same, denying their said agreement (though sufficiently prooved before his Majestie) and then by force of presents and mony given under hand to the Officers of that time, so prevailed against us, that wee could not onely not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Right, which since hath appeared unto us, and (as well by their own agreement, as by his Majesties judgment then, Custome, and their former contracts) was due unto us; but were forced after to other agreements with the said Company, by which (over and above all such Rights, Privileges, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisits, as then were and should bee granted unto us by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Capitulations, and besides all other gratifications and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances accustomed to bee given to his Majesties Ambassador, (which in houshold provisions, only the said Company, assured us were to the vallue of 800 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> sterling, at least) and over and above such Plate, and Houshold Stuff as they assured us, wee should finde of theirs here, and hold to our use during our residence, (of which wee found not the vallue of and Asper)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38106:12"/> the said Company did covenant with us, (for and in respect of our paines and care only therein agreed to bee taken by us, in their affaires and occasions as aforesaid, for and during all our time as his Majesties Ambassador with this State,) they would pay or caus to bee paid unto us the sum of five thousand<note place="margin">viij. <hi>Sterling.</hi>

The said Company (upon conditions between them and us agreed) did also promise to give us content therefore; with intent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless thereby to get advantage of our credulity and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and to draw us out of suspect of their evil intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, which hath since, (as well by their several interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and hinderances here in the Collection thereof, as their practises, and endeavours at Council Table before his Majestie, and by their other appeals to the Courts of Parlament, where in these times of distractions, they presumed of som better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) hath appeared unto us; Whereby, and by suggesting several untruths against us, and by other false wayes they have endeavoured not only to deprive us of the strangers Consulage, and benefit thereof; but under that colour also and these their pretences, to keep themselvs from paying, as us from taking such other Consulage, as was, and is as much our right, and due unto us from themselvs, by the said Capitulations and the Grand Signor's grant thereon, for all their own goods Traded in; And now of late, but suspecting our just intentions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a claim thereto, (for untill this present day wee never made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38106:12"/> any demand therefore, or publick pretence therein) to prevent what they suppose wee might justiy do in our own right, (for wee take God to Witness wee know no other caus) under like unjust and scandalous pretences, wee are certified that they not only go about to get us remooved from our employment here, but <hi>upon fals suggestions,</hi> loos and bare suspitions onely, <hi>have gotten Order</hi> for the seizure of all our Lands and other Estates in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> into their power; as som of their own Servants and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors here have the confidence to report and affirm; and as <hi>wee are assured</hi> from thence, without hearing of us; nay, so much as intimation to us of the grounds thereof, or such matters and things as they pretend at least to have against us, whereby wee might answer for our selvs; and so, whil'st wee are labouring (as for these many years wee have don, with all fidelity for them and their publique Interest, (whereof, as wee have proof sufficient in our actions, so wee have him that is Judg of the World for witness to our Conscience) they are <hi>contriving the ruine of us and our Posterity;</hi> which manner of proceeding so <hi>unjust, horrid,</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> before God and Man (as in all reason wee ought) taking to heart and our serious consideration, and as well that violence which is offered to the Lawes, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Honor and Interest therein, as our self and our family) not pretending to extend that authority which his Majestie hath put into our hands to unlawful ends, but only to make a just use of it for the right &amp; lawful defens of our selvs &amp; it in the several occasions aforementioned; finding by acompt under the hands of the Treasurer of the said Company here, that for such goods as they have brought in and carried out from the Port of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there is due unto us according to the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and the Grand Signors grants therein, to the value of Dollars Ryals of 2/8, seventy four thousand; and that for the like in <hi>Smyrna</hi> there is due Dollars Ryals of 8/8, one hundred thousand <hi>in circa;</hi> and rating that Estate in Land which they have gotten into their power as aforesaid, but at the value wee were offered for it, <hi>viz.</hi> at ninety seven thousand and five hundred Dollars; in all, two hundred seaventy one thousand and five hundred Dollars.

               <p n="3">3. Whil'st you are laboring in this fair way, to these ends, and before you discover either too much passion, or eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in pursuit thereof, or ought of your farther purposes, you must by all possible means and wayes seek to discover, what Goods and estate, each of the Nation (especially those before mentioned) have in their houses, and Magazeens, or carried abroad. <hi>viz.</hi> and principally Drugs, Cotten, and Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graine yarnes, and more especially Silke, and Cloth: for the better knowledg whereof, you are to send som <hi>Armenian,</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> Broker about, under colour and pretence of buying or bartering, for som Cloath, who by that advantage m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But (as before directed) you are not to stir in the Second Warrant, untill the first have taken place, and you see the issue of that for the Leviation, on which if they pay you money there into the hands of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> (which as before will bee impossible for them) your work will bee so much the easier, that money will serve mee as well: if they cannot pay, but offer your Bils without caution by pawn, you are not to take that, nor to accept any personall security, no not all the Nation for one of them, but in such case to proceed to a sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, and then bee sure you seiz enough, and all you can fasten on, especially of those men under the marks before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But if they com to give Bills for the Money, which is

In case none of the two propositions take place with the Nation touching the Leviation, <hi>viz.</hi> either for payment of money there, or by Bills of Exchange, with security by pawn (wherein you are to know that <hi>the Law is</hi> on your side, and giv's you liberty to take what security lik's you, or refuse what like's you not) and that you bee thereby driven by way of force to make a seizure (which I doubt you will bee) In such case by means of the * <hi>Chiouz</hi> and * <hi>Caddie</hi> (as in <hi>Lorenzoe's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) you must first seize the persons most refractory, or most usefull to your occasion, into the <hi>Chiouz's</hi> hands; and keep them safe from communication with any other of the Nation; then seal up their, and every of their Ware-houses refusing; and after break them, and every of them open, and thence at your leisures, take out and carry, into som Cane or Canes first prepared by you, so much Silk, Cloth, Grograin, or Cotten-yarn, Druggs, Wax, and other like Merchantable Goods as you shall finde, and may amount to the value of his part of the Leviation so refusing; with ⅓ part more, as before; and the same shall keep so arrested and seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred untill farther Order from us in that behalf; into what

               <p n="6">6. For your better means to effect these ends, you must bee carefull, and as much as in you lyeth, and before you begin ought, by Friends, Presents, Money, or els, first to make the <hi>Caddie</hi> sure to you, and so his x <hi>Neipe,</hi> and those in credit with them, whether of his houshold▪ or in the Town; and especially amongst those of the Town, <hi>Bustangees</hi> and <hi>Aga;</hi> and having them with you, and beeing backed with those Commands and that <hi>Fettfaro,</hi> which you have in your hand; you need not doubt of prevailing over the other or any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing you, the chief and principal beeing settled, whom you may confirm yours, by telling them that the Trade, and so their good is concerned, advantaged and protected by the Ambassador, and his care thereof, whose proper work that is, and that power given him by the Capitulations, and the Grand Signors express commands now sent with <hi>Fettfaro</hi> thereon; declaring that all our Subjects should obey our Orders accordingly, without which it would bee impossible to have any Trade continued here or there, or they have any Commerce or benefit thereby, there beeing none almost now but English that Trade, and that must also fail if their publick Debts bee not paid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For this purpose, you are to spare no charge, whatever it cost; wee resolving to make the Estate of such as resist, to pay the expence, as well as our demands; and therefore you are well and diligently to observ the proceeding of the <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and working of the Nation with him, or the Town; and accordingly, and with a diligence proportionable, ply your business.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For the better effecting whereof, considering your self and the Druggermen as strangers to the forms of that place, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38106:19"/> that those of the Nation may bee false to you; and to the end you may not bee to seek, as well for means to com ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Caddie</hi> and other chief men of the place in occasion, nor how to discover our Merchants Estates and proceedings, nor to have a constant intelligence on them, or want help in occasion; you shall make use of such Letters as you will have from the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, and our self, to the <hi>French</hi> Consul there, praying the Astance of his Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germen in your occasions; under which gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38106:20"/> will have this advantage, that what ever you give, come's out of their main stock; and so you may spare the less.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I hope the Customer before your arrival will bee a little calmer, then hitherunto hee hath been, and at last forsake the Merchants part; if not, you shall do well on your first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, as on your old score of friendship, under colour of a visit, to make him sensible, not onely of those curtesies I have formerly don him, but to let him know how sensible I am of such his proceedings, and how contrary they are to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and oaths to mee, in case I could get him to bee made Customer of that place; at last, and in extremity, that if hee persist, you have power sufficient to curb him, or send him to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and see first before you com to action, how that language will work with him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If this take no effect to make him yours, (which I wish, if possible) you may tell him, hee can but expect a Custom for those Goods, which are ready to bee transported; and that whether those Goods go by these Ships or Land, hee shall have that, and a present to boot; conditionally hee suffer no Goods to pass by day or night, but such as hee shall have your or my allowance and note for, under your hand; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if hee will assist you, that is, to deteign such Goods as I shall have occasion to attach and arrest; for all such as you arrest, you have power upon his performance of his part, to give him Bills for, payable by mee to the import of whatever they shall amount unto in Custom, together with such present to him therefore, as you and hee can agree for.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In case this will not serv his turn, you are then to proceed by the <hi>Caddie,</hi> to mak <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. Thus having latitude without limit to procure our just ends in manner before prescribed, as you are carefully to intend the matter committed to your trust; so you are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and with moderation to attend for sit time, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv our directions in the series and succedency for manner of your proceedings; not absolutely limiting you, however therein, but (not having opportunity, first timely to advise us at this distance, and as otherwise might bee necessary in such case) observing and taking a fair and probable way to the main end you go for; wee leav you at liberty to do what shall appear most requisite; nevertheless willing you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise us of all such digressions, and alterations in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, with the causes thereof, by expresses from time to time, and on all occasions; that thereon wee may govern our selves, and direct you as may bee most requisite for effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of that you go about, with Honour to his Majesty and safety to our selves.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That Letter you carry with you to Mr <hi>Lancelot,</hi> will shew you and him the caus why I desire not to make use of his hand in this particular; it agreeing best with his own desire to bee spared in it; however if hee stand not inclined to the Leviation, and to farther it, at least comply therein for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his proportion, and stand neuter for the rest; the first man you are to begin withall must bee hee, whose person though as beeing Consul wee will not have you attach untill our further order (except in case of resistance) yet you shall enter into his Hous and Warehouses, as being a Marchant withall, and there seize, sequester, and take away, as in any other man's case, in the manner, and to the ends afore spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>

               <p>VVHereas wee have heretofore in the name of the Grand Signor been required by the Vizier, to will and command that none of the ships of his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatever, coming into the Ports of <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> should depart; or any ship coming into the Port of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> should lade or take aboard them any Goods or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, or bee dispeeded thence, until licence from the Port, and our order thereon and in that behalf: And whereas the said pleasure of the Grand Signor, aswell by his own Imperial Commands, as by the Capt. <hi>Bassa</hi>'s letters, and our Orders thereon, have been signified to the Consul and Nation at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and to the several Masters of ships there; And that yet som of them still continue lading, and notwithanding have since such Order and Command, dispeeded som ships from that Port, to the hazard of the lives and fortunes not only of them that have so laden &amp; been aiding to the dispeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such ships, but thereby given scandal to the sincerity of his Majesties friendship, and such jealousies thereon, as (in these times of Warr and Difficulties) may endanger a rupture between the Kingdoms, divers of the ships of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties subjects at present being joyned with the Venetian Fleet; and actually in consort with them, lying and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the mouth of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> ready to give the Grand Signor's Fleet battel at their own doors, and issue out of ther Ports. You are hereby required once more strictly to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and in his Majestie's name to charge and command all &amp; every of his Majestie's subjects, Masters of ships riding in the Port of <hi>Smyrna</hi> whoever, to forbear taking on board their or either of their ships or vessels, any Goods or Merchandize for the account of English or other whoever; and that they depart not the said port, untill wee shall bee able to procure

                     <p>I Have this day received Letters from <hi>Smyrna</hi> of the 22. and 25. of <hi>April,</hi> finde thereby that <hi>Porter</hi> was not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38106:26"/> that the <hi>Chouz</hi> with the Druggerman were arrived; that all they or M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>Lancelot</hi> had done, was by a Letter rather to send him away than summon him, for ought I can discern to the contrary: wherein hee had intimated to him the Grand Signor's pleasure and my Order for his stay. In fine a piece of the old story, others not beeing to bee expected from one so deeply interested in the others lading. In conclusion, I finde <hi>Jorden</hi> come into that Port also unladed, and to have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for his lading there, without regard to his promise or my ingagement for his lading here; and that also by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>Lancelott</hi>'s perswasions, contrary to the others own resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (as his Letter relate's) the meaning whereof can bee no other, than that hee and the Nation have been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whil'st hee hath endeavoured to make mee believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; <hi>viz.</hi> the carrying of all out of the Countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the Leviation, &amp;c. for that's the very language of the Nations meaning, whil'st they desire 4 moneths time yet for payment, (as those that have advice of that resolution pretend and say); but I have not yet received their general Letter, though divers Copies thereof are come to Town, which is a Riddle also.</p>
                     <p>Upon the premisses I shall not finde cause to alter any part of your Instructions, but second it in all as well form as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>viz.</hi> First to proceed with that business of <hi>Porter</hi> and his Laders, to clap them up and make them and their Estates sure, as directed; then to proceed to the Leviation; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let the other fall in of cours, and take it's place in time. Only one Caution I shall think good to add, that in case there bee not or you cannot get a resolution for the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a general consent in Court, with a Pawn for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in such manner as is directed; you need not trouble your self with that, but according to that List and Schedule annexed to the Order for Leviation, proceed to a sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and possession of every mans particular apart, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Consent of the whole, by staying or looking to an Act of Court of their assent there; for you must know that this is an Order for execution, and an Act of Justice, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38106:26"/> from mee as his Majestie's Commissioner, and you are to govern your self accordingly, and as men sent on such an Errand; and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Edwards</hi> hath given order for his part of the Leviation money by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>Piggot;</hi> who even now make's tender of it to mee, and happily will think much to bee arrested for that: But I take no notice of any such tender to mee in person; the first Order run's for payment into <hi>Cancellaria</hi> by such a day; your Order goe's for Leviation and Charges for non-payment there; and (believe mee) the Charges of their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> must bee born by them of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and not by mee or the Nation here. But leaving that dispute aside, (as a thing by the by) in case M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>Edwards</hi> should object this as a reason of his, for avoiding his part of the Charge, or for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Caution; you may say that untill it bee certified to you, you can take no notice of it, neither spare him nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in the mean time are to proceed with him as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and over and above, in case hee should (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Order of his before mentioned) bee contented yet to give in Caution by Pawn, as others are ordered to do, hee proving faulty in Lading the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> you are to proceed with him according to your Instructions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to such effect; for (I confess) I long to have him in my power, of all men in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> having suffered by him more than by any one there, except one that you have advice of.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, taking all you have to do into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I finde you have a difficult part to act, and therefore you are to bee sure to take it by those degrees you are directed in, and to be sure to avoid the confounding of one thing with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and in the last place to make your demand of Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, &amp;c. as by your last Warrant, but not that neither untill further Order, (I mean on the whole Nation).</p>
                     <p>And touching that, of <hi>Lancelott</hi> and his Companion, to proceed by degrees with them also, or rather than fail h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38106:27"/> not for the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> for having laded on the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> contrary to order) you may let that pass till their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival here (having first sealed up their Warehouses and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houses, as directed,) by the by however getting what advice you may touching their carriage of that business. And whatever you come to discover, shall act, or do; I pray advise mee from time to time, &amp; daily, or every two dayes at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest; for your intelligence will bee the onely rule for my future direction; not having further to add that I can think necessary at present I rest.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>I Have this morning by the Consuls Messenger received the Originall of the nations generall Letter subscribing to the Leviation, desiring respite of payment for five moneths time; to which I give that answer you will finde in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of mine to the Consul herewith sent you; by which you will discern that I still drive the business to a Caution and pledg; and with all reason I may demand it, for by that time they may have conveyed away their Estates, or received som other order from <hi>England,</hi> and so frustrate the Leviation totally, &amp; leav &amp; the Nation here under the Debt and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which you may let the Nation know I have no reason to admit of, and so not to contradict that order I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly sent, which is to demand your Caution for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: next (suppose they would now pay the full, actually in hand to my Druggerman, you are to say, you have not power to take that neither, without like security for the Charges of their former refusal; which what it is or may bee, by their contrasts ensuing, I have not been nor shall bee able to set down in particulars, untill I see the issue. Whatever it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38106:27"/> may bee, they may bee sure as I seek noe advantage in that, so I am resolved not to loos by it, and lay money out of my purs for their defaults; So if they consent on these terms, give you good caution into your hands, to bee put apart by you into some place under your power, you may consent; and having done so expect my further Order thereon: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you are to proceed without more Ceremony in the way you were first directed; And so I once more leav that business, the rather findeing that the nation here will not bee otherwise satisfied with their assurance, for ought I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, by those I have hitherunto spoken with; resolving to morrow to call a Court, and then I am sure to finde this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theirs more confirmed, (as I am sure I must) when I shall demand all mine own monies, amounting one way or other to near 30000 dollars, to bee presently paid; and to say truth, I am not resolved to exspect much longer for it. You will by the inclosed see what I write to Captain <hi>Jorden,</hi> and if I might yet expect to finde him other then a Tarpawling, I could wish hee would yet take in such goods as might offer themselves at <hi>Smirna</hi> on this occasion, and come up to <hi>Constantinople</hi> therewith; from whence I would assure him as good a fraight, as ever hee had, better then hee can expect from any hand in <hi>Turkie</hi> without mee. If you finde him not too much otherwise ingaged, or changed to be round since I saw him; you may sound him to that effect, having first in your power sufficient to lade him with for this place: If hee refuse it; or accepting, give you not a chearfull assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to comply therein, you are not to suffer him or any other to lade, until further order from the Port and mee; but protest against the customer and Merchants whoever till they shall lade on him or the other ship in Port: If on this, for the better disguise of the business, hee will bee contented with a Warrant of mine to press him to this service, you shall have that also; and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, partly by denying his Lading there, on the one side; partly by Warrant and Command on the other, hee may seem to bee constrained, and so for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater Inconveniences, to embrace the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38106:28"/> assuring him that in case his ship bring not up those goods another shall or a Carravan: If hee shall have taken in any goods of strangers (which hee pretends to bee in a treaty for) they may likewise be put onshore again, upon &amp; under colour of command from mee to desist the voyage; and if need bee I shall send a Command from hence to that purpose also. If the Customer shall be brought to dispute the business, you may tell him other goods shall bee laden in the room, &amp; those of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on other Ships now coming down, &amp; pay him as good a Custom or better, with a 2<seg rend="sup">d</seg> advantage to his Patron here: wherein (if <hi>Jordan</hi> consent) you are not to be scrupulous to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Customer, and so <hi>Jordan,</hi> som considerable advantage to themselvs apart and beyond their Ordinary way; and this still to bee carried under the Cover of Command from hence, and my order thereon; wherein (save in that to <hi>Jordan</hi>) you are already sufficiently Warranted. And for that also you shall with these have Warrant and Order, effectual to bee made use of in such occasion, as by the inclosed; <hi>viz,</hi> 1. a Warrant, a new prohibiting anv others lading: 2. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against <hi>Jordan</hi> for not complying with mee; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless I would not have you use or drive to the extremity, untill further order, but seeming (as before that hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues inclined to his Majesties service and not changed from his former profession, by and with his consent, as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, to make use of them, as in publick to draw him to it, as it were by an outward seeming force; If hee dispute the loss of time, you may assure him, that it will not bee long but he shall have advice of an open Port and a freer seale here, then there; for the Gallies resolv and are Ordered to depart the Castles on Monday or Wednesday next, and then the issue of that business will bee quickly seen: the time hee shall spend in Demurrage between this and that, or her, shall likewise bee considered: which offers you must know, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of som hope that <hi>Jordan</hi> may bee yet a little hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster then his fellowes, (that is more likely to bee firm to mee in my design) otherwise finding him or having caus to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the contrary, you may let him go as hee is, that is to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38106:28"/> say not trouble your self with looking after him or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state much; onely hinder him and all others from lading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I am Master of that I aime at; for upon your advice I shall make use of som one of these Ships here to transport my Wife and Family, and provide for the rest in time. God bless your proceedings, and my just endeavours to a lawfull defence. Whil'st I rest</p>

But my Lord, I wish better to them, then to accuse or to blame any, onely my own hard fortune, that at my entrance into a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of trust, I should proov so unhappy, and bee so much abused; For as I yesterday advised your Lordship by this ungratefull fellow, the Consul with six more of the chief, were rendred at Justice before the <hi>Caddie</hi> into the <hi>Balouke's</hi> hands; who prrsently brought them home, and according to your Lordships order, wee desired him to keep them close, and not to suffer any to com to have any discours with them, for prevention of som such design as was acted on <hi>Porter;</hi> and accordingly hee did, and nayled up the Windowes to the Chamber, and promised me to carry them away as last night himself, for stay hee would not; but after this, hee suffers the Consuls Druggerman to come and treat with him, and for a present of Dollars 100 caused the Windowes to bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and suffered his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

I told them I came not hither to bee made a slave for the Companies Debt; I had their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to see that paid by Leviation, and that Leviation agreed by their own, &amp;c. bade them welcom to the trouble of their own procuring, and so left them for that present to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consideration, in the mean time put a guard upon them.</p>

Lastly, if the Customers should make opposition, or scruple; you (as I formerly advised and secured you) may promise him his Custom for any Goods whatever you shall bee possest of by his means or discovery, with a Present to boot, and to his content; and then I know none have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but my Master's own Subjects, who by the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Fettfaw, and Commands in your hands, ought to bee under, and subject to my Judicature onely, in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending

               <p n="14">14. For your better assistance yet, and to the endl may leav no way unthought of, or you unwarranted or undirected to that end you go about; I have herewith sent you Warrant to require security of the Nation (especially those to whom any of the Ships in Port shall bee consigned, or any other you shall know to have estate of the Captaines in their hands, or to have laden on the said Ships) by pawn, to the value of their lading at least; and that the Captain or Captaines of the Ships shall not depart the place therewith without my leave and order; and in case any of them refuse so to do, you shall require their appearance before the <hi>Caddie,</hi> and there demand their Persons and Estates into your hands, especially of these Merchants and Traders left behinde, <hi>viz. Davis,</hi> the other <hi>Barnardiston, Inglesby, Ball,</hi> and such other of them as you shall finde busie in lading, or to have laden any considerable Estate on the said Ships, or to have any Estate of the Masters of Ships in their hands (the said Masters not complying and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38106:35"/> obedient to my Orders in manner as directed) wherein (as I wrote Mr <hi>Jordan</hi> yesterday) hee and the rest must pardon mee, if I value my self and Hostages, at least equally with them, if not before; and the Publick before any ones parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: however in due time shall have care of him, that, and the rest also, and all as becomes mee, if they will have but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and bee ruled by mee, discover what Estate they have on board, and for whose Accompts, &amp;c. which doing, they shall see I will deal them that Justice in the conclusion, that they shall have cause to thank mee. But if by the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others for private ends, they steer a contrary cours: though <hi>Smyrna</hi> bee a great way off mee, they will finde by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that I shall have means and power to reach them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Even now I am advised, that there is another English Ship arrived about <hi>Smyrna;</hi> the name I hear not of, but that by advice from within, the Ship should ride without, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves for <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> and to discharge and take in her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there; for prevention, I hope to get you a command yet before the <hi>Chiouz</hi> depart, to secure that other corner also; least that outlet should bee more troublesom than the other.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Lastly, upon serious considerations, and by all I can judg of by the discourses, fears, and contrivements of this place; I conclude that your shortest and securest way to your end (upon finding the least appearance of the Masters jugling with you, or of the Ships lading or departing, and not having a true discovery of what is laden on each of them, and by whom; or finding any of the Nation underhand assisting or abetting in any way contrary to your Instructions) will bee to fall presently to work on them that move or resist you, as by your Warrant herewith sent you is directed; which agrees with the Command &amp; my Opinion, which is, that by delaies, or a seeming retreat (at least untill what is discovered be made sure, and these Ships bee made render what they have of our Nation on them) we shall get little advantage by suspending; however leav all to your nearer Judgments, according to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion on the place, for which your Warrant is large enough. And so for the present I bid you farewell, resting</p>

               <p>HAving made an end of this dispatch near two daies since. I have stayed expecting, and untill this hour do, the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouz;</hi> whom they pretend to stay for some Services of the Grand Signors, as they did the last: but I hope this day to get him dispacht, and so come to my private Instructions to your self:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wherein (as in my Publique to <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and you, as also in your former) you are to make that of Publique shew its face outward, and to come first in Action; the first part of that pretence is now almost finished, I mean the Leviation for Past-Charges; and when that shall bee fully finished, I resolve to begin with Prouision for the Publique in future; taking into consideration the distractions of <hi>England,</hi> the War at our door here, the <hi>French</hi> forces before <hi>Ligorne:</hi> and by all these a likelyhood that wee may bee in an ill condition here, ere long: and therefore it will bee fit to look out in time, and provide some means at least, for future subsistence; wherein the Company stand obliged to the Crown of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> by their Charter, and to mee by their Covenant to make Provision.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When this in hand is done, that other may bee taken order for; and in the <hi>interim,</hi> under the colour of the one and the other, the full of the Estate or most of it may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and after this, I shall have opportunity to bring in my own pretences, for which you have Warrant sufficient and particular with you already; and this latter Warrant now sent you, will serve you for the other two— and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the business, <hi>viz.</hi> for finding out, discovery, and securing what you finde until further Order, in what hands or place soever; However, I wish it by convenient degrees and steps, at least not findeing occasion to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. With the Merchants, in its time you may treat their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38106:37"/> reason apart, <hi>viz.</hi> that this concerns their own preservation, as well as mine; and that they may be sure before any Estate more goes out of the Countrey, I will see at least how as well this, as that Scale may bee preserved; That a Factory, this a Residence, untill it may pleas God wee meet with better times.</p>
               <p>With the Masters you may deal in another way, (if they or either of them deserv it,) <hi>viz.</hi> assure them a good and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable fraight, if they will but have patience; and so may happily also consider their demurrage, in case they behave themselves as they ought; on the other side they may bee sure, I will not overthrow so just and reasonable a resolution and design of the Publick, and of so near a relation to the preservation of all the Trade, Peace, my self and Hostages here, for the consideration of 2 or 3 ships particular accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, or their demurrage a moneth more or less; and if you finde them not capable of this good Counsel and reason, or not so consciencious of the other as to prefer it before their own Ends, you are to proceed with them accordingly; for, I have no such obligation to either of them, as may seem weighty enough to ballance the former.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now in case any of the Factory after payment of their Leviation mony or securitie therefore, should desire to bee free to lade, or to have their Estate at Liberty; you are to tell them that by fresh Order from mee, you have command to hold the Goods, and Ships as directed, &amp; upon the grounds aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> till provision for the future bee mad;e this Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being alreayd eaten up and spent, before paid; and though you should have made any other pretence hitherunto, (though till further direction you had not Order at least to mention ought of my particular beyond the Leviation) you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it lightly, and say you were merry with them, ctc. as they are often with mee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If any should question the reason and ground of this proceeding now, that was never in President before, you may bid them and the Company thank themselves for a great part of it; for (besides the reasons before expressed) they have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38106:38"/> Ordered their Factors to convey away all their Estates, and to leav mee naked here, and the General of the Trade at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and every one to shift for himself; which I beeing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised of, have reason to look out as well for theirs as my own safety. Next I have heard of som Combinations against my particular, and shall desire to provide the best I may for that too; but bee sure you discover nothing of my own pretences, untill the last, and that not untill further order.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You will in your Warrant, and so in the Command, finde Order for rendring into your possession all goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the Ships, belonging to any of our Nation; wherein I would have you walk with great circumspection; First to discover from the Customer and Masters what and by whom laden, (I care not so much for whose accounts, though if you can get that, it will bee well, and a further advantage; for if it bee for any English I care not for whom; or if by any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish laden, I care not by whom:) then to sequester it: and that done, take Caution of the Master beeing aboard, and party to whom it belongs, that it bee alway forth-coming upon further Order; which if either the Master or Merchants shall refuse, you are without further respect whatever by the <hi>Chouz</hi> and <hi>Caddie</hi> to take them into your possession, as in your Instructions, and by the Command directed, which is to be your refuge at all times. In case the Masters shall say that they cannot tell to whom the goods belong till Bills of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding signed; they cannot however deny to tell you by what and by whom laden; at least the Customer if hee will, can discover it, and you are to press either according to occasion; and if need bee bring them before the <hi>Caddy to</hi> that end; and (in case they refuse) there endeavour to caus them unlade a new; wherein the Customer shall not loos his Custom, you agreeing with him to that end.</p>
               <p>If they have not signed Bills of lading (as most likely they have not, for that is commonly the last work) discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whose goods they are, or who laded them, you are to forbid the Masters to give Bills till further Order; and if the Masters refuse or delay, to proceed against them according

               <p n="7">7. In case of resistance or any Clamorous Hubub, as in <hi>Porters</hi> case, by the Mariners, you may require a guard of the <hi>Caddie,</hi> and promise payment for it to their content; or make use of the Castle to hold your prisoners in occasion; (for I shall little doubt to use <hi>Turkish</hi> help against those that oppose that authority of my Masters which I hold in <hi>Turkie</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: and I conjure you bee not scrupulous in that— what will com of it: However, look you proceed not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor unadvisedly in any thing, nor suffer your self to bee particularly provoked, and so spoil your Cause, but proceed alwaies according to the Command and style of the plain, Lawes, and formes of it (where my authority will not serv) <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Caddy</hi> and power of the place, &amp; their own officers, whatever you pay for it, which in all occasion will bee your justification and mine: and they will second your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with <hi>Arz</hi> and <hi>Maxars</hi> from time to time to the Port; which in occasion you are to seek and to back your self and mee withall: and for this end bee sure to keep the <hi>Caddy</hi> and those about him so much yours, as not to suffer the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Masters of Ships or other of the Town whoever, to have any: at least to such effect as may do you prejudice or the Cause.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For search and entering of houses to that end, (though that bee the substance at the Command and shadow of this dispatch, and really the substance too, in occasion) you are to proceed in that with care, respect, and moderation also having good assurance by particular marks, signs, if you can, or witness touching what you go about and pretend unto, before you force or enter any place, for books or other things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Touching those four men principally appointed to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, you shall observ a fit time for that, that is either fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them lading or to have laden since order, or to conceale their Estate, or to have conveyed them away, and thereon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38106:40"/> take them into your possession, and if need bee (doubting their disturbance or future procedings in lading &amp;c.) to send them away immediately by som of the <hi>Chouzes</hi> servants; which, I know will not onely startle all the rest below, and give them new occasion to a better submission, then to think to conquer by a contrast. However have som such occasion first, or at least pretend it if you want one; for ti's all one in this case, and I confess I had rather you send these men away, then meddle with the Masters (if you can avoid it) for all their principal Traders and Patrones beeing sent away, the Masters must then perforce obey or bee gon, as they are, laden or unladen, (which will trouble them more then all the o-other sort of force you can use to them.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. You are to observ, or at least to demand in my name, and by my order, to whom this new come Ship is consigned; and from that Party or Parties demand security in the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; or for default proceed with him and them as in the other directed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If <hi>Bogus</hi> perform not what he hath promised me (with a thousand oaths,) <hi>viz.</hi> if hee hinder not the Ships from lading, take not order, and secure you, that they depart not without your leav and my direction first had; or discover not, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at least by some probable waies to discover such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Merchants as are concealed, or shall do any other trick out of Rule, or against you; without saying much to him or quarrelling the thing there, send mee word by an express immediately, and by a horsman if to bee gotten.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When you send any express at any time, be sure you do it privately, for the Merchants there have way to intercept Letters; And I doubt that Messe which your last promised mee the next day following may have miscarried, for hee appears not yet, it beeing four daies since the others arrival; The first Mess was twelv daies on the way, the last but eight. But I think I may thank the good Company for the formers stay, who were not willing hee should arrive before them; send therefore a servant a dayes journey out of Town with those you send hereafter, and let none know of your sending
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38106:41"/> away (not the Post-master or Cape of the Messes) till your Letters are ready, and then see them sent away presently, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, requiring him not to take a Letter from any els but your self.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Though I hope there will bee no occasion for you to doubt; yet I would have you circumspect (especially if you should come to any contrast with the Masters of Ships) that the Mariners take no advantage of you by a surprize, or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares do you an affront or mischief; you know what sort of beasts they are: For which respect (in occasion) you may by the <hi>Caddies</hi> Order have a guard of his Servants, Souldiers of the Castle, or Janizaries, a dozen or more as there shall bee occasion: But I have no other thing that put's mee in minde of this, but what you your self mention in yours of their Bravadoes: However give them no advantage either by your doubts or over security.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Lastly, (for I can at present think of nothing els ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,) if you want or think you shall want money for your occasions, you must supply your self by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; for there is neither Credit, nor Bills to bee expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from hence, but what you have, or the Customer. In case it should come to a Vye there, and the <hi>Caddie</hi> were to bee presented, you may secure him by part of the Estate, till you can get Bills, or I provide for you. And so beeing weary and late, go to rest, resting.</p>

What care and Industrie I have used in their service for these 8 years, you have in part been an eye Witness to, and they all know the rest; and now (without so much as declaring the cause) to proceed with mee in the manner they do, exceeds the injustice of <hi>Turkie</hi> it self. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> I have ever found you honest and faithfull to mee, in all I ever yet trusted or employed you in, and I am confident you will not fail mee in this that concernes Mee, my Wife, Children, whole Estate; wherein value your self and service to mee at what rate you will, I will recompence it, so you bee faithfull to Mee; which by the Laws of God and that Duty you owe Him you owe Mee also as a sworn Servant, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this of my just Defence, as against the assault of Theevs on the High-way.

                     <p>I Have yours of the 30 of <hi>May</hi> arrived in six daies, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the delay of mine, and your want of Order, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my dispatche of some further help and supply of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
                     <p>Yours accuse the receipt of mine of the 5, 6, and 7 past; want the 17 (which I also doubt miscarried) and mine of the 27. by <hi>Bizadee Chouz</hi> could not then bee arrived you, but before this I hope may bee.</p>
                     <p>By him you will have received fresh and full Commands in assistance of your power, and by him directions (in case you wanted money) what to do, which way to repair your selvs; <hi>viz</hi> either by Bills of Exchange, or by som of the goods under your hands, in case those that promised payment there, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed not, &amp; thereby gave you supply; for from hence I found no possibilitie of getting credit for money, and happily the <hi>Caddie</hi> would be contented (if for a reasonable sum) to take Bills of Exchange payable to some of his Friends here.</p>
                     <p>For advice in what concerned the carriage of your Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; those Letters, as also mine of the 3 and 4 present (sent by a several expresses, as duplicates of each other) will have sufficiently instructed you, if arrived; as I hope before this they will bee.</p>
                     <p>In adjunct to which I send these confirming my former, with this addition only, <hi>viz.</hi> that you proceed to possess your selvs, as soon as you may, with what you can, and the same take into your power as pledg and securitie for the future provision of the Trade, and my indempnity from such unjust pretences as the Companie have raised against Mee. In prosecution whereof, you are to proceed by such gentle steps and paces, as may best and with least non effect your
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38106:42"/> work, and yet secure that you go about: I confess I have required of you a large summ in my last, and when I came to cast up those dammages I may sustein, the summ rather falls short of than exceeds my just doubts of their injust Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon what they have in their powers to prejudice mee in, and I am certified they have made themselvs Masters of in part: However I must content my self with what I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently do, and not strein the cord too farr, least it break and requoil upon Mee, to the hazard of that hold I had of more, and what I might have made sure of, and so must leav that still to your discretion to mannage; with this Order notwithstanding, to take into your hands as much as you can of the finest Goods you can get; and where that fails, Cloathes will bee no ill merchandize, and so good security.</p>
                     <p>The Murmur here riseth every day to greater wonder, where these clouds will dissolve and terminate, which I keep obscure hitherunto, though not unsuspected; the rather, for that they say Captain <hi>Jordan</hi> is coming up, of which I hear not though deny not but hee may, (not complying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself as hee ought) and so who els of those there upon the same occasion: and your Rule is such at least for those 4 or 5 principally directed in my former.</p>
                     <p>As I promised you in my last, I shall begin my work here much about that time you are directed to set forward there; whereof within three or four daies you will be advised more certainly.</p>
                     <p>To morrow wee shall have a Court, and I shall there lay the foundation to the work, assuring my self of a denial before-hand, of what I am to demand; and then you may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what will follow.</p>
                     <p>My Demands will bee just, and grounded on their own Covenants, backed with Law and Equity, and so long I have seldom forsaken a good Cause; on the other side hitherto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pursued an ill, at least contrary to my knowledg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which by God's assistance shall bee my guide in this.</p>
                     <p>I confess I like not so well your lodging in any Merchants house; for 'twill bee impossible for you to keep your designs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38106:43"/> from view, and your necessarie discourses from the discovery of others in an others house, where you must exspect to bee watched, and your papers sought after, and to have all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble art and intention used to circumvent you, though (I am of your minde) Mr <hi>Campion</hi> bee one of the best of them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Merchant still.</p>
                     <p>Next I should bee glad to hear you were removed from the water side, that is out of Marriners roade, and (if in that place you rest in you bee so) you have done the better; but whatever you do, have a care of a surprize, and next of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrayed through any sort of confidence, or by any mens friendship whoever; and I the rather write this from some discoverie made out of these Letters which came enclosed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yours, from that partie you think most sure, directed to a friend of his here, which I keep by mee against a fitter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                     <p>Beyond which I can say no more at present, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of yours material and unanswered, nor further to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, but that I rest exspecting your further advice of what you have done, that I may proceed accordingly, resting</p>

If that report be true wee hear, that <hi>Hassan Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobee,</hi> shall bee Customer, and <hi>Bogus</hi> return, wee may bee able to do something, though I fear not much. For though En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish mens Goods, yet in anothers Warehous, will finde it a difficult business to prove it sold, and delivered and paid for, and will afterwards rather trust a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> then let your Lordship have it. I beseech your Lordship, with the first to inorder us how to dispose of such goods as we hope to have here, and which of them must bee sent up; the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities here are Cloth, Silk, Cotten yarne, Grograin yarn, &amp;c. and they say in Master <hi>Lancelots</hi> hous is store of Tinne, (but Mr <hi>Santhill</hi>'s) I hear to the value of 40 or 50000. dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; If wee can procure here dollars 100000. for your Lordships use, I hope it may help satisfie your Lordships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, 'tis but taking the more above, if your Lordship can finde it. If wee can possess our selv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s of the <hi>Jonases</hi> Goods, which may amount to dollars 50000 more, being as they say half full, and all fine Goods, the <hi>Golden Lyon</hi> brought Dollars 9000 to <hi>Barnardiston;</hi> I shall search narrowly for that, and have some good assurance to finde out where the Money or Goods are; I wish my abilitie answerable to that servent desire I owe and bear to your Honors Service.</p>
               <p>This day arrived a <hi>Saitie</hi> from <hi>Marcellis,</hi> and brings hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full news from <hi>England.</hi> His Majestie being blockt up in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> disguised himself, and with a servant or two resolved to run the hazard, and put himself into the mercy of the <hi>Scots,</hi> rather then stand to the curtesie of the Rebels at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and 5. of May, by day break, His Majestie arriv d to the <hi>Scots</hi> Army near <hi>Newarke,</hi> to the wonder and amazement of them

Where tis advised hee was entertained with all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; they presently gave the Rebbels advice of it, (as by the inclosed) who presently sent the <hi>Scotch</hi> many expressions of their thankfulness, and withall desired them to conduct him to <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle, and there to deliver him into their power: the <hi>Scotch</hi> denyed it, and craved their excuse, His Majestie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their power; would first bee assured on what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons His Majestie should come, and if his Majestie liked them, and was willing to goe, (otherwise their pardon,) they were His Subjects, and must obey him, and would, and pretended they sought nothing, but the good of both Kingdomes, and they did not see that His Majestie demanded any thing unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; upon the arrivall of this answer at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners and the Roundheads differed, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners told them plainly they demanded things unreasonable for the King to grant. What issue the happy difference may breed is doubtfull, but it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p d may better His Majesties condition much, they begin at <hi>London</hi> to speak high language against the Parliament, and are doubtfull because Lord <hi>Montross</hi> is marching towards His Majestie with 12000 men.

               <p>YEsterday wee received your Lordships of the 4 present, being the Copy of the 3. And to day wee received your Lordships of the 8. and rejoyce to hear your Lordship is in such a readiness for your just demands, and wish your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship less trouble, and better success, then wee this day have had, and wee doubt for many dayes shall incounter here: this morning the <hi>Caddies</hi> son, with his <hi>Neipe</hi> and principall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came, and wee began first with the Consulls hous, but before wee began 'twas spoken in the <hi>Caddies</hi> own hous, &amp; all over the Town, our design to seiz what we could finde; about 7 a clock his son came &amp; entred the Consuls hous, &amp; opened all the Warehouses, and took from thence, with <hi>Elfords</hi> and <hi>Keebles,</hi> som 400 Clothes, &amp; 9 Bales Mohairs; we left behinde us 38 Bales of Silk, 13 Bales his servant pretended were sold by his master to Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> to be paid by Bill of Exchange at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and when advice came the Bills were paid, the Goods should bee delivered; in the mean time they lie in Mr. <hi>Lancelots</hi> Warehouse, with some 40 Clothes, 60 Barrels of Tynne, which Tinne belongs to Mr. <hi>Sainthill,</hi> and sealed up by the <hi>Neipe</hi> and us. Before wee had ended at this house, the whole Town was in an uprore, being fomented by Jews, and som of the young frie left behinde, and proclaimed in the Streets, that the Town would bee undone, the Trade lost and go to wrack, if this was suffered; so that before the Consulls door were so many of the scum of the Town, the Streets were packed thick of them. On the other side, a more unruly enemy threatned worse things, the Master of the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Lyon,</hi> who had before given <hi>Barnardiston</hi> 9000 Dollars at
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38106:45"/>
                  <hi>Cambio,</hi> and had no Goods in his possession, hearing how it would fare with them, lands 40 men at <hi>Barnardistons</hi> house, and vowed hee would have his money or goods, or swore hee would beat down the Town; so likewise the <hi>Jonas</hi> got her sails to yards, that the <hi>Caddies</hi> son and the <hi>Chiouz</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to let it alone, untill another day, for fear of wors events'; so when they had made an end at <hi>Lancelots</hi> hous, would stay no longer, but promised to come another day. The Estate before mentioned wee carried away in spight of envie, and have put it up in a safe Cane: assoon as this was done, becaus the Captain would not come ashore, I got <hi>Jordan</hi> to go a bord the <hi>Golden Lion,</hi> and know the Master his intent, and to acquaint him with the danger might ensue thereon; all wee could urge was nothing, except▪ hee had satisfaction for his 9000 Dollars; at last told him, if hee knew where his Estate lay, wee would endeavour to help him to it, so hee found it out, and wee delivered it to him, and the man was very well satisfied. And now wee hope to finde little impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to morrow morning the <hi>Caddies</hi> Son promiseth to come again, and wee doubt not the same day but to make an end. If your Lordship saw the little regard these people bear to the Grand Signors commands, the <hi>Caddie,</hi> or ought els but their private ends, your Lordship would (as wee hope your Lordship will) not blame us if procured but the half of what your Lordships Letter mentions. To morrow (if God bless us) wee shall send your Lordship more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall advice, and for the present crave leav to subscribe our selves,</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38106:46"/> was not one to bee seen; so beeing alone, and seeing his Boat coming ashore well mann'd, and fearing a surprize, wee presently repaired to the <hi>Chiouzes,</hi> and desired him to go with us to the <hi>Caddies,</hi> to see if wee could have any better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from him. By this time the Town was in a great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, and the people something too insolent; the <hi>Caddie</hi> to prevent the worst, presently caused the Shops to bee shut up, and immediatly sent for all the chief men of the Town, (who by presents before wee had made our Friends) and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, and a great company of the Townesmen, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Commands to bee read, and told them how much they were bound to see the Grand Signors Commands put in execution, and what dishonor it would bee for one Ship to command the Town: so after they had disputed the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the <hi>Caddie</hi> sends an Officer aboard (accompanyed with the Druggerman to the Nation) to know whether hee would hinder the prosecution of the Grand Signors Command or no, and to know his answer; hee presently denyed hee ever intended to shoot at the Town, onely desired his own; so presently after the people were a little appeased, wee went to work again, and so this day have finished all: it beeing done in such confusion, wee cannot give your Lordship that exact accompt you may expect, within a day or two; for then wee will send your Lordship the particulars, with the values, in mean time wee stand upon our guard, having some 20 or 30 of the Souldiers of the Castle to keep watch every night; for, (my Lord!) here is no small hubbub in the Town, and threatning both of us and the Estate, but wee will secure both as well as wee can. Wee have sent your Lordship a rough draught of what wee have, and what wee have left sealed up, and finde it fall short farre of what your Lordship expected: the sooner your Lordship disposes of it, the better; for assure your self, there is daily some designe or other hatching; wee should bee very sorry after all this to have it miscarry, therefore pray (my Lord!) dispose of it (to prevent the worst) as soon as you may.

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and many others, pretend Debts of many of those people that are gone up, and would know who shall pay them, and pretend to bee paid out of their Estates; but wee have put them off, telling them, wee believe your Lordship will hardly let your Estate go to pay their Debts; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, shall advise your Lordship of it: so have secured none, onely to one <hi>Huzoone Amet Aga,</hi> one of the chief men in the Town here, Mr <hi>Lancelott</hi> having given him a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for 475 Dollars, and the Bill returned unpaid, wee were forced to deliver into the <hi>Hangees</hi> hands for his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity 10.

Wee beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to bee as speedy in the disposure of this Estate, as with your Lordships best advantage may bee convenient: For my Lord, the truth is, wee do a little doubt the security of it, as it lies here, and were your Lordship an eie-witness to those insolencies wee daily see here against the <hi>Caddie,</hi> and Grand Signors power, your Lordship would endeavour a speedy removal of it, as wee may seem to bee importunate to your Lordship. For,</p>
               <p>The Master and Merchants dare not trust themselvs ashore, onely <hi>Jordan,</hi> and three or-four of the Factors that are good subjects to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Wee have been forced to pay privately some Debts to the Grandees of the Town to stop their mouthes; as that to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zume Mamet Aga,</hi> for the Bill of Exchange hee had of Mr <hi>Lancelotts,</hi> and was forced to give them a 11 Clothes for his Debt; so likewise to a <hi>Greek</hi> of the place, one that was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to Monsieur <hi>Jean de Puii,</hi> who pretends <hi>Barnardiston</hi> is his Debtor 410 Dollars, hee beeing in Prison; Monsieur <hi>Jean de Puii</hi> desires us to lend the man two Clothes, and hee has obliged himself to us here, that if your Lordship allow not of it, hee will bee responsible for it.</p>

               <p>The last night arrive Newes here, that your Lordship has imprisoned the whole Nation at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but from which of the Nations hands wee cannot discover, and how your Lordship makes large Demands upon them, and has declared Master <hi>Wylde</hi> uncapable of the charg of Consul, having taken the Covenant, which makes all these that are left here almost at their wits ends.

I heartily wish it were but as much as the least of these summes, if not the most; whatever it bee, more then what you last sent mee in yours of the 19 of <hi>June</hi> (if ought more, which I believ not) I pray send mee word, and by a Horseman alwaies express; for yours of the 16 fell into the Rebells hands, and your last gave mee no Copy of it. What
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38106:50"/> noise soever you encounter, I charge you budg not out of your place, or posture; for the storm is over, and God bee thanked I have broken their waves. And I doubt not but you will see a calme game played for the after one; for which I have fair blots, if any of them hit; hitherunto it hath not cost mee an Asper, for till the Officers bellies were prettily well filled at my neighbours, I knew they would bee costly guests on such occasions; now having been feasted with them a day, two, or three, I shall provide a banquet for them too, but at their cost (take my word) that are the occasion of my trouble. By the next express I pray send mee back those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Consulage I gave you <hi>John Hetherington</hi> under <hi>Brents</hi> and <hi>Lancelotts</hi> hands, and advise mee whether you have learnt any more of those particulars <hi>Read</hi> told you of; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have <hi>Lancelotts</hi> papers and Accompts under your power; and bee sure whatever you have, hold, and make them safe.

I have not more to trouble you with at present, but to desire you not to bee troubled with these troubles and encounters, that might justly bee exspected in a business of this nature, though not driven to this height; but the Sun it self hath its time of declining, and so Mr. <hi>Lancelott</hi> and his Gompany.

               <p>WHat I delivered you in Court, and demanded as in your generall answer aforegoing, I acknowledged for truth, and for the grounds of my demands then expressed for so much as to that day I had been advertised by four seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dispatches touching the beginning of the <hi>Levant</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies endeavours against me in <hi>England,</hi> and here; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all or any of you bee certified thereof or no, it concerns mee as little to inquire, as to believ one way or other: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it little for your advantage to confess it, if you bee; however, this I must profess, that the first alarmes I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in likelihood, were about three months since, and they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38106:53"/> came from some of your selvs, by name Mr <hi>John Wyld,</hi> Mr <hi>Thomas Berkley, John Tye,</hi> and <hi>John Plumer,</hi> all of one hous yet, and of this place: Moreover, by report from the three later, about that time, that there was an Ambassador, by name Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew</hi> comming, who was said to have the Kings Commission, and other Orders to surprize mee, and take my charge, &amp;c. Of this latter news I confess I am not yet advised, though but this last week I was assured that Mr <hi>Thomas Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> should say to several men of this place, English and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it would not bee long before they had anothar Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador here, and then they should see great and strange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That securiry demanded of you in a case of this nature, I conceiv the most improvident and inconsiderate amongst you (were it in his own) would hold it for reasonable and just, and where ever this caus shall come to bee referred, I presume will bee esteemed accordingly, as well by the Rules of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that natural policy and justice which every creature takes to it self, and for it's own defence; whereof (at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from resort to other justice, having the power of a Judg, and a publick Minister on the place) I intend not to bart my self, lest another day I may bee judged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned improvidently and pusillanimously guilty of my own unjust surprize, losse of my Estate, ruine and beggery of my Family, by such illegal and unchristian practises.</p>
               <p>Though you may say, and I deny not, that as servants and Factors you are not criminally bound to answer for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences or injustice of your Masters; yet in actions of this nature, having Estates of theirs in your hands, by whose means the violence aforementioned is obtruded on mee, <hi>viz.</hi> My Estate seized, my Person intended to bee sequestred, and Place violently surprized, without so much as intimation of the caus; I do in justice require security of you as servants and Factors to the <hi>Levant</hi> Company, by whom these things are prosecuted, and out, and by the means of their Estates in your hands, and to the value before mentioned, for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tie; which demand of securitie, I desire you to believ
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38106:53"/> and credit mee in, was not a begging question, but a milde overture to you, and a quiet prosecution of that rule of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, whereby I have for near these eight years now governed amongst you; before I proceed in such course as the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the cause would otherwise inforce me to, of farther prejudice, and happilie inrepairable dammage to you refusing; which I lay before you, for better consideration this, second time, desiring you to believ that this proceeds not of vanitie, nor out of any relenting resolution, or want of power, from the least doubt of that dust some of you have improvidently raised to your own ruines, if I should pursue the advantage of the justness of my Cause; but meerly out of that desire I have of your better accommodation in my safetie: if you can by fair means, see you give way to it in the Propositions laid before you; and if not, that I may hereby (as in the sight of God and all his Angels) wash my hands, and free my conscience of all mischief that may follow, and of his ruine and misfortune, whoever complies not in his proportion, in that just way proposed, to secure mee, and to free himself and the publique Interest; to which end, if this bee not of force enough, you may bee sure of more: And so Gentlemen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Complements, or regret to the Person of any, I rest, as hitherto you have found mee, and I desire to bee continued,</p>

Wee shall, according to our obligation, give your Worships some accompt of the last progressions of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> whom his Majestie sent hither Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, and to bee a Protector of your Estates, and our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; how he hath performed this charge and dutie formerly, your Worships have in part heard; what hath happened of late, wee shall now chiefly insist upon.</p>
                     <p>After his Lordship had caused the stay of the ships in this Port and at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> under pretens of this States requiring it in respect of their Wars with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> Merchant, having been here almost seven moneths, to the great loss and dammage of Ships and Goods; Hee picks a quarrell with the Factory of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his Order, in the payment of their parts of the last Leviation money; and hereupon sends down <hi>John Hetherington</hi> one of his servants, a most lewd, debaucht, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, riotous fellow, (yet his Lordships Kinsman) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two <hi>Chiouzes,</hi> two <hi>Druggermen,</hi> a Janizarie, and other Servants, to proceed with those who should refuse to pay their Leviation according to the instructions hee had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38106:54"/> given the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo Zuma</hi> Druggerman; but before the arrivall of these Agents, the Nation there had undertaken the payment by an obligatory letter to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; this would not satisfie, nor deposition of goods for security, untill answer should come from hence of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Bills of exchange which was tendred; but the second day after their arrivall, <hi>Hetherington</hi> and his retinue goes to the <hi>Caddies,</hi> and thither causes the Consull and all the Nation to come; where it was pretended they had laden the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> with Corn, and sent her away, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by vertue of an Imperiall Command (very privately here procured) the Consull, and six more of the Nation were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of the <hi>Chiouz,</hi> and so brought up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not being suffered to return to their own houses, but put a day and a night into an offensive dark place, the doors and windowes not only shut, but nayled upon them, not suffering either their Friends or Servants to come at them, or a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow open till the evening, for which also they paid Dollars 100. In this disgracefull manner they were brought hither, where they have been since the 22 of the last moneth, Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in his Lordships house to the 21 present, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had complyed in paying the Leviation moneys in lesse then a week after their arrivalls; and by fair promises put off from day to day, for their dispatch to their business <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which could not but much suffer by their absence; their Magazines and Counting-houses continuing sealed from the time of their attachments; the Ships not permitted to lade or depart, though empty; and no debts due to them would bee paid in this their absence and time of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>The Leviation monies being satisfied (of which Dollars 31000, his Lordship forced into <hi>Cancellaria</hi>) and wee of <hi>Smyrna</hi> expecting no more rubbs in the way, his Lordship the 16 instant calls a Court, and there declared, that of what monies had been collected, there would not remain much on the old Accompt; therefore provision must bee made for the future growing charge, for so much as upon this pretended
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38106:55"/> imbargoe, no Ships would come in haste, and hee and his must bee maintained, which hee would provide for; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when wee could not do otherwise, Dollars 25000 was promised, half by this Factory, for which his Lordship cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us to enter into Bond, as hee did those of <hi>Smyrna</hi> for the other half; this being effected, which we should not neither altogether have been so ready to have complyed in, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to put a period to all other demands, and enable our selves to proceed in our business for your Worships better service.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38106:55"/> sealed up, to make sure of our Goods and Estates there also: continuing in this sad condition all night, and finding no motion to proceed from his Lordship to declare himself farther, four or five of us was appointed by the generality, personally to crave his Lordships particular desires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of us; whose answer was, that the lowest value hee could put upon his Lands the Company had sequestred, was 25000 pounds <hi>sterling;</hi> and for the loss hee should su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tain by beeing put out of the Ambassadorship, which hee saith his Majesty hath granted him for his life, therefore the Strangers Consulage hee rates at Dollars 5000 <hi>per annum,</hi> which for the clear gain of seven years to come, is Dollars 35000. for which hee declared that hee would not accept of any perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal security or obligation whatsoever; but a present dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dollars 160000 in Money or Goods, into his own hands must bee made: And if to this wee would not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, hee told us, that at the last Sacrament had vowed to God (as hee doth now) to sacrifice his Estate, Himself, Wife and Children, for the execution of this his absolute intent; and till then, neither our Persons, Estates, Ships here, or at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> should bee free. Wee told his Lordship, that finding not any of us had heard of any such things was (or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee) done against him by the Company, it would give us great satisfaction to shew us those advices hee grounded this pretence upon: To this no answer was then given by himself, but dismissed us, leaving it to our last and speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, because hee was resolved to strike home. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, hee sent us word by a second, that hee could not let his Honour descend so low, as to shew his advices to any; this empty reply gave us too much reason, not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this to bee a feigned pretence, but made us suspect his intention and aim was at all the Nations Estate in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and therefore wee returned him this reasonable and defensive answer, as your Worships will particularly perceive by the inclosed Paper: whereunto is adjoyned hit Reply to that our answer, as hee pretended, though it appears it was intended before, it beeing dated a day before our answer.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38106:56"/> Whil'st thus wee continued, it happened that those four of us were fortunately absent from Court that day, who hearing of our conditions, wherefore, and why wee were thus detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what an ill period these proceedings tended unto, if not timely &amp; prudently prevented, they used their best endeavors to free us and your livelihoods from the claws of tyranny and covetousness; they applyed themselvs to Signor <hi>Illustrissimo Coppes</hi> the States of <hi>Hollands</hi> Agent, who as hee was ever a friend and favourer of the Nation, so now hee gave us good and great testimony thereof in this our greatest need and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: and chiefly by his means with a summ of Money; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the clamors of the Jews, and many other of the Grand Signors Subjects against this our present abuse, and destruction of future Trade; The <hi>Vizier</hi> (whom they had well and fully possessed with the truth of all things) after three daies imprisonment sent a <hi>Chiouz</hi> for us to his Lordships hous, from whence wee were carried before the <hi>Vizier,</hi> who much upbraided his Lordship, saying, hee never gave him Commands for such proceedings, notwithstanding his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships avaneous allegations against his own Nation, by saying an English ship at <hi>Smyrna</hi> was laden with Powder, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c, and there resided for assistance of the Turks Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and other the like abuses and destructive courses against those here, tending not onely to the confiscation of Ships and Estates, but the risgo of enslaving our bodies, if not the loss of all or some of our lives, had his hellish Plots taken effect. The next day after our general Commitment, arrives five more of our fellow Factors from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> there seized upon and made Prisoners, and so by his Lordships command, in that nature brought to his hous, and put amongst us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the advice from their correspondents hence was at <hi>Smyrna</hi> (before their departure thence) that their part of leviation Money was all paid in here, yet their leviation, with ⅓ more in Moneys and Goods was taken again from them by his impudently impious Ministers there, and all the rest of their Goods continued sealed up: so the intent (as your Worships may plainly perceive) was no other than first to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38106:56"/> get the moneys here payed, then to seize upon their Persons, and next to take away and secure their Estates; thereby to prevent a just, reasonable, and natural defence; and now it too plainly appears, (because his Lordships imployers had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken course no messengers should come unto us;) Horsemen are daily dispeeded unto us by our Friends at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> advising us to the 20 instant, of the unnatural and devouring progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions they had there made, which was done by the assistance of the <hi>Caddie,</hi> whom they had well bribed, beginning to act there at the same time as wee were here all imprisoned, so there was no intent of staying for our answer to his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant demands. They first fell upon Mr <hi>Lancelots</hi> house, thence proceeded all throughout the Nation; so that they have not only taken away all the Goods, Moneys, and effects whatsoever they could finde in their houses, at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but broke open and ransack'd all our Chambers, Trunks, and Counting-houses, which mounteth to a farr greater value than his demands of Dollars 160000; and by large promises to Informers endeavour to discover and take what is owing them abroad by people of the Countrey, and have so threatned our Friends and Servants to deliver our Books, and declare where's more of our Estates, that they are constrained to leave our naked houses to the open world, and betake themselves to the Ships in Port for refuge: All this it seems cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Wee have been now seven dayes out of his Lordships

All which (by the assistance of our obliged and worthy Friend <hi>Sig.

               <opener>
                  <salute>Right Worshipfull Sirs,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT may pleas you, our last from hence was <hi>per</hi> the ship <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> advising his Lordships proceedings for another leviation for discharging your Debts at <hi>Costantinople,</hi> beeing then informed that the whole amounted unto Dollars 118109; and how wee were resolved to withstand it, untill your Worships further pleasure should bee signified unto us concerning the same, for such reasons as wee then presumed to lay open unto you; and that in the mean time wee had presented our grievances to his Lordships gracious perusal, the Copy whereof went annexed to our said Letter, to both which you may pleas to have reference.</p>
               <p>The 24 of <hi>March</hi> following, our Consul called a Court, and declared his Lordships answer to our said Letter, disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our proceedings; and by a new Order prohibited the lading of Goods, and receiving them on board, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Ships, untill the said leviation were paid accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his former Order, and Schedule now sent down, shewing each man his proportionable part for this Factory of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> amounting in all to Dollars 54950, and for the Factory at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to Dollars 56000; is together Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars 110950. Whereupon, wee generally desired that his Lordship would bee pleased to suspend the execution of the said Order of leviation, untill such time wee should receiv your Worships farther Order about it, without which, wee our selvs were like to pay it out of our own Purses, as in the last leviation; receiving since particular Orders from some of our principals, not to pay any leviations, otherwise it should bee for our own Accompts, and not theirs.</p>
               <p>The 24 of <hi>Aprill,</hi> the Consull called another Court, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38106:59"/> unto us that his Lordship did require an accompt for the departure of the Ship <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi> contrary to his Lordships Commands, there beeing an Officer of the <hi>Viziers</hi> come down to apprehend Captain <hi>Tho. Porter,</hi> and to carrie him up to <hi>Constantinople</hi> (which Ships departed at their own pleasures, beeing not in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to stay them.) And that concerning the leviation it was inevitable, and his Lordship was resolved upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would sorce us unto it, and expect repair of Honor from the Delinquents; whereupon fearing his Lordships farther displeasure, which might beget som greater inconveniencies amongst us, wee presumed to yield unto his Lordships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by way of a submissive orderly complyance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selvs unto the payment of our parts of the said le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, in proportion to the Estates wee received on the last-general Ships, <hi>Hercules, Sampson,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna-Merchant,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our particular assessments; as appeareth by our general Letter presented his Lordship, and entred in <hi>Cancella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> grounded upon the result of this dayes Court; desiring his Lordship would bee pleased to allow us four moneths time for payment, for such reasons as wee have alledged in the same.</p>
               <p>The 6 of <hi>May,</hi> the Consull told us hee had received other letters from his Lordship, prohibiting not onely the lading of Goods, and the departure of any Ships, untill the leviation bee settled; but also therein more fully signifies and declares, that untill the Grand Signors Fleet bee gone forth hee canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> permit any Ship, either at <hi>Constantinople</hi> or here, to lade or bee dispeeded, and that accordingly his Lordship is so requi-of this State. And in like manner hath ordered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded those whom it concerns both above, and in this Port to observ the same. And moreover farther witnessing, which accordingly (as hee said) hee was bound to acquaint us how that the Embargoe at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and here was seconded, and his Lordship to avoid farther dangers and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the Publick, could not refuse his consent thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:38106:60"/>
               <p>The 10 of <hi>May</hi> arrived here Mr <hi>John Hetherington,</hi> a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Lordship, and Signor <hi>Lorenzo Zuma,</hi> Greek, one of his Lordships Druggermen from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who the next morning moved our Consul to call a Court for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where being assembled, the Consul told the said <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that their desires were performed, and therefore required them to deliver what they had in Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from his Lordship; who produced an Order of the 27 <hi>April,</hi> directed to the Consul and us, for payment of the said Leviation forthwith, or else to proceed according to his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order, Warrant, and Instructions in such behalf, and we to bee answerable to such loss, dammage, and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as may ensue thereby. To which wee answered, that the Leviation was subscribed unto, and therefore desired the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to stay four or five daies, untill his Lordship should return answer to our Letter of the 24 of <hi>April:</hi> the said <hi>Lorenzo</hi> told us, hee would retire and peruse his Lordships Commission, and in two houres return, to have a more full and satisfactory answer from us: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, hee declared that his Lordships Commission re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired forthwith ready Money or Goods; (beeing his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from which hee could not vary.) Whereupon Mr <hi>John Lancelot</hi> first answered (as hee was a Merchant) he could not deposite his Cloth, for his Credits sake, but would give his Bills for his and Mr. <hi>Dixwell Brents</hi> proportionable part of the leviation, payable at <hi>Constantinople per</hi> Mr <hi>Thomas Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> at five daies sight into his Lordships <hi>Cancellaria;</hi> which was refused, unless they would deposite the value in Cloth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> part more towards charges, in the possession of him the said <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> which they said again, for their Credits sake (as they were Merchants) could not consent unto; so referred themselvs unto the said <hi>Lorenzo's</hi> farther proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if these proffers would not bee accepted of, beeing not possible for them at present to procure Moneys at Interest, or otherwise.</p>
               <p>The like conditions wee all in generall profered for our proportionable parts, but were refused by the said <hi>Hetherington</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:38106:60"/> and <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> whereupon the Consull told them, they had all our assents for payment of the leviation; and if that, with such reasons and proffers as wee propounded, might not bee satisfactory, the Consull and wee in generall referred our selves to the said <hi>Lorenzoes</hi> farther proceedings.</p>
               <p>After this, the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> presently re-repaired to the <hi>Caddies,</hi> accompanied with a prime <hi>Chiouz</hi> of the <hi>Visiers,</hi> and declared their farther Commissions; after publication whereof, the <hi>Caddie</hi> sent for the Consull, and all our Nation, where the Capitulations were first taken away by Warrant, and the Consull in a most barbarous manner was laid hold on, with <hi>Dixwell Brent, Daniell Edwards, John Pixley, Samuel Barnardiston, George Hanger,</hi> and <hi>James Moye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and committed Prisoners into the custody of the said <hi>Chiouz</hi> and Officers, and transported to a house (taken by them on purpose) where they were violently, and in a formidable manner thrust into a dark Chamber, and at length were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to present Dollars 300, to have a window set open to give them light and ayre; the Consull telling the said <hi>Hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> before hee was surprised, in the presence of the <hi>Caddies,</hi> that neither hee, or the Nation, had any wayes transgressed the Grand Signors or his Lordships Commands, and that hee did not fear what they could do unto him, no not so much as to dye, in performance of his faith and trust to the <hi>Levant</hi> Company, whom hee had truly served, as likewise for his love and affection hee bore to the Nation here under his charge, whom hee would never betray, hoping shortly to see his own Countrey again. And in two hours after, the said <hi>Hetherington, Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Chiouz, Caddie,</hi> and <hi>Neipe,</hi> sealed up all our Counting-houses, Magazines, and some Chambers; and in two dayes after transported the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners overland, up to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his Lordships power and safe custody; wee in the mean time being left like so many Sheep without a Shepherd, and ignorant where to seek protection.</p>
               <p>The next day after departure of these Prisoners, the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> sealed up our Cloth in our own
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38106:61"/> Warehouses, for what concerned our proportionable parts of the Leviation, at the rate of Dollars 45 <hi>per</hi> Cloth, and ⅓ part more towards Charges.</p>

               <p>In few dayes after arrived here one of the principallest <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouzes</hi> of the Grand Signor with new commands sent down by his Lordship, by vertue whereof the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> seized upon the Persons of <hi>John Ball, Henry Davey, Phillip Farwell, Nathaniell Barnardiston,</hi> and <hi>John Ingoldsby,</hi> who were committed prisoners to the said <hi>Chiouz,</hi> who used them with some humanity, and sent up the next day to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> to be delivered unto his Lordships power; after whose departure (all Law being set aside) the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> by this command came down, opened all our Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, and by violence carried all our Goods away into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Canes of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as well what they had sealed up, for the Leviation, as all other Goods of what nature soever they could finde, unless it were such as was sealed up, and belonged to <hi>Turks,</hi> and other of the Grand Signors Subjects, and left many of us so bare, that wee had not wherewithall to afford us a piece of Bread, to ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38106:61"/> Ships <hi>Rainbow, Jonas, Hopewell,</hi> and <hi>Triangle.</hi>

               <p>In all which time of this distraction and sufferings our miseries have been much condoled by the chief <hi>Turks</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this place, who seem to sympathise with us in our sad conditions; and had not the Commands been so powerfull, the whole Town would have risen up in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens and protection, who have privately advised of these abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which as they themselves confess, are like to ruine, not only this scale, but that of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> also, to the dishonor of the Grand Signor, and ruine of many of his Subjects, and of a profitable and acceptable friend (our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to become a potent enemy against them.</p>
               <p>The 28 of <hi>June</hi> came letters from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> advising the <hi>Visiers</hi> Order for rescuing both Factories from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships imprisonment, and particular advice to some of us here left, for apprehending the Persons of the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and to keep them in safe Custodies on board our Ships, fearing (wee having no order as yet to receiv our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states out of their possessions) they might convey our said Estates away, or sell them for half their worth, and so make their private escapes out of Town, expecting dayly a <hi>Chiouz</hi> to carry up their Persons to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to free our Goods, hoping all will go well again for us. Hereupon the very same day, the said <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> (without any nois or rumor) were by the Marriners conveyed on board severall Ships from the said <hi>Hetherintons</hi> lodging; <hi>viz. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therington</hi> on broad the <hi>Triangle, William Hodges</hi> Commander; and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> on board the <hi>Hopewell, Nicholas Terrick</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; where now they remain, to the contentment of the inhabitants here, who daily expect their sending up to the Port, there to answer to such crimes and insolencies as shall bee objected and proved against them.</p>
               <p>Thus wee have presumed plainly and distinctly (according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as wee conceive it becomes us) though briefly, to present unto your Worships perusall, the whole process of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships proceedings against us here in <hi>Smyrna</hi> (since our last) according to our experience of the passages; by which your
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38106:62"/> Worships may easily conjecture his Lordships farther inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And for what hath occurred at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> your Worships will receiv by this conveyance, advise to both which wee pray you to bee referred; which being taken into your deliberate considerations, may afford such future means of protection, and incouragement to enter into a way of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Turky Trade in such a posture, that wee hope these loss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
